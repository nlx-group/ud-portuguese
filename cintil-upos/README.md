# CINTIL-UPos -- CINTIL dataset annotated with Universal POS tags

Files are in TSV format (tab-separated values) with two columns: tokens and UPOS tags.
Sentences are separated with empty lines.

The file `cintil-contracted-upos.tsv` contains text as it normally appears in written form, with certain expressions in contracted form, such as "do" which results from the contraction of preposition "de" with definite article "o".
